# cworld
cworld is a simplistic learning project that attempts to create a simulated environment with plants, animals, and other entities and to study their iteractions under both planned and spontaneous interactions of their artificial intelligences, or lack thereof.

cworld is created and (thus far) solely maintained by myself, J. C. Ethan Busbee.
Given that its primary reason for existing is for education, you should feel free to utilize whatever lessons or code snippets that you find useful in your own projects. Just remember that figuring it out for yourself works a lot better than just copying someone else's code whenever something goes wrong!

And on that note, do remember that I'm just doing this as a hobby project. I'll be making some odd design decisions for the hell of it, and it's not likely in your best interest to try to rely too heavily on what happens when my code breaks something it wasn't intended for!

And whether or not you choose to credit me if something I did has helped you, just pay it forward and help someone else learn something new, won't you?

PS: If you do want to contribute to the project in some way or just bounce some ideas off of me and vice versa, I'd love to hear from you! You can most easily reach me by email at JCEBusbee@gmail.com.
